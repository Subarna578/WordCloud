We are small consciousness, as already stated, and god is supreme and infinite consciousness. We are a fraction of energy and god is the powerhouse of energy. God supplies energy, and thus we are able to utilize it. If the powerhouse stops giving energy, our existence is over. But this doesn’t happen because the energy is infinite and God himself cannot stop it. Spiritually, getting happiness is the easiest thing. We just have to meditate lovingly on God. But how to meditate on someone who is not visible? For that, we just create an imaginary but divide form of the body and assume it to be the form of God. And then keep on imagining yourself with that body loving, caring, sharing … doing everything behavior that a person does with his family, friends, relatives. This is practically called Sadhana or Bhakti in eastern culture. As we practice in this loving meditation, we get pints of original and divine happiness that we never received. And once, when we attain hundred percent devotion in Sadhana, we will experience God i.e. we will be god-realized. Our all senses will be divine, and divine will be able to comprehend God. We will accomplish our human form of birth. We will get the happiness we had desired right from the moment we took birth in this world. We will be self-sufficient and self-satiated. We will get everything because we will be everything.
